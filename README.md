# Oasis Themes

This will be a short explanation on Oasis Themes

There are three types of Themes

- Single Color
- Multi Color
- Gradient

---

You can specify Colors in 2 ways

- `rgb(255,255,255)` as RGB
- `#FFFFFF` as HEX

---

1. `Single Color Themes`

```toml
Type = "Single"
[Colors]
Color = ""
Background = ""
```

---

2. `Multi Color Themes`

```toml
Type = "Multi"
[Colors]
First = ""
Second = ""
Third = ""
Fourth = ""
Fifth = ""
Background = ""
```

---

3. `Gradient Color Themes`

```toml
Type = "Gradient"
[Colors]
First = ""
Last = ""
Background = ""
```

---

Now replace the colors in the example with the colors you want and put it in your themes folder.
Fill in the name of the file in the config and restart the Selfbot.
